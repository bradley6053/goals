```

## What works
- Goal model with increasing/decreasing direction, milestones, progress fractions (`GoalMath`, fully unit-tested).
- **Three goal kinds** (`Goal.goalTypeName` → `GoalKind`): numeric (start → target readings), **count** ("do X 100 times", one-tap "Check in +1", multiple per day), **streak** ("X days in a row", strict midnight reset, one check-in per day, last-7-days dots). Streak milestones/completion key off the monotonic **best** streak so claimed rewards never re-lock (`achievementValue` in Models.swift — don't switch it to currentStreak without revisiting the milestone-stamping logic). Pure date math in `Shared/StreakMath.swift`.
- Shared save path `App/Support/ProgressLogger.swift` — numeric log sheet and habit check-ins both stamp milestones/completion through it.
- Goal list, detail, create/edit editor (kind picker on create only — kind is locked after creation), log-progress sheet, milestone celebration view.
- Home-screen widget reading a shared snapshot via the app group (`WidgetSnapshot` + `ImageStore`).
- Demo data seeding for previews/first run (`-seedDemo`, `-seedGolfDemo` launch args).
- **Golf tab** (Sweetens Cove theme — cream/pine/sky, serif club headers, "Golf is supposed to be fun"):
  - Bottom TabView: dark Goals tab + light Golf tab, each with its own chrome.
  - Course search via **OpenGolfAPI** (free, keyless, `api.opengolfapi.org`) with scorecard pull-in (tees, ratings/slope, per-hole par/handicap/yardage); courses cached in SwiftData so replays work offline; manual course entry fallback.
  - Hole-by-hole round entry: swipe pager, strokes/putts steppers, fairway (hidden on par 3s) + GIR toggles, penalties; live OUT/IN/TOT/vs-par footer; resume in-progress rounds; 9 or 18 holes (front 9 supported on 18-hole courses).
  - Round summary: classic scorecard grid (circled birdies, squared bogeys), stat chips, score distribution, shareable scorecard image (`ImageRenderer` + `ShareLink`).
  - **Fun feature 1 — Personal Bests:** course-record trophy wall (9/18 split), longest birdie streak, full-screen PB celebration with confetti.
  - **Fun feature 2 — Course Passport:** stamp per course played, 5/10/25 milestones, MapKit pin map (no location permission; `CLGeocoder` fallback for missing coordinates).
  - **Fun feature 3 — Live Round Vibes:** confetti + haptics on birdie/eagle commit, hot/cold streak banners.
  - Deep link `ember://golf` and `-golfTab` launch arg jump to the golf tab; `GOLF_OPEN` env var (simulator) jumps to a specific screen for screenshots.
- Golf data: 5 new SwiftData models (`GolfCourse/GolfTee/GolfHole/GolfRound/GolfHoleScore`) added additively to the existing app-group store — goals data verified intact alongside.
- **Timers tab ("Dad Clock")** — dad-life countdowns with a wind-up dial and Live Activities:
  - **Winding dial:** drag around the circle to wind time on like a kitchen timer — 1 revolution = 60 min, 1-min haptic detents, multiple laps stack hours (4 h cap), counter-clockwise unwinds, springs to whole minutes on release. All angle math (incl. the 12-o'clock unwrap and center dead zone) is pure in `Shared/TimerMath.swift` — 21 tests.
  - **No SwiftData:** timers are Codable JSON at `AppGroup.timersURL` (`active-timers.json`). Remaining time always derives from `endDate` — nothing ticks, so force-kill/relaunch loses nothing. `TimerStore.sweep` drops fired timers on launch + every foregrounding.
  - **Presets:** Leave the House 🚗 / Bedtime 🌙 / Clean-Up 🧹 / Screen Time 📺 / Turn Timer 🔁. Chips pre-wind the dial with a spring; Bedtime counts down to a wall-clock time (set once, `Calendar.nextDate`-based) and starts on tap; the turn timer rotates kid names ("Next · ⟨name⟩" one-tap handoff). Long-press a chip → customize sheet (time / minutes / names), overrides persist in the same JSON.
  - **At zero:** local notification with per-preset playful copy, scheduled at start, cancelled/rescheduled on pause/resume (`TimerNotifications`); permission requested contextually on first timer start; `Haptics.unlock()` if it fires while foregrounded.
  - **Live Activity:** `TimerActivityAttributes` (Shared) + `TimerLiveActivity` (Widget bundle) — Lock Screen banner and Dynamic Island (compact/minimal/expanded) driven by `Text(timerInterval:)`/`ProgressView(timerInterval:)`, so the system advances the countdown with zero updates/pushes. `staleDate = endDate` dims it after firing; cancelled timers end `.immediate`, fired ones linger ~4 min at 0:00. Skipped for timers > 8 h (system cap). `NSSupportsLiveActivities` lives in `project.yml` under the **main app's** info properties. Orphan cleanup on launch.
  - Deep link `ember://timers`, `-timersTab` and `-demoTimer` (2-min sample countdown) launch args.

## Open threads / possible next steps
_(No specific in-flight task was recorded when the prior session terminated — the codebase was left in a green state.)_
- [x] Widget timeline refresh strategy — streak snapshots now get a midnight timeline entry (`displayedStreak` re-derives the shown number so a lapsed streak reads 0 without the app opening); other kinds unchanged (app reloads timelines on every save).
- [ ] Local notifications / reminders for **goals** (timers have theirs; goal reminders still open).
- [ ] Timer feel-tuning on a real device (dial drag friction, haptic detents, Dynamic Island) — simulator can't judge touch feel.
- [ ] Optional: confetti celebration when a timer fires in-foreground (deliberately left out of v1 per Brad's scope choice).
- [ ] iCloud or persistence review (where are goals stored today?).
- [ ] Chart/history visualization in `GoalDetailView`.
- [ ] Broader test coverage beyond `GoalMath`.

## Changelog
- **2026-07-04 (night)** — Added the Timers tab ("Dad Clock"): winding-dial timer UX (`TimerMath` pure enum, 21 tests), JSON-persisted `TimerStore` (no SwiftData — schema untouched), preset chips incl. clock-anchored Bedtime and a kid turn timer, local notifications at zero with playful copy, and Live Activities (Lock Screen + Dynamic Island, zero-push `timerInterval` views). New launch args `-timersTab`, `-demoTimer`; deep link `ember://timers`. 69 tests green; verified in simulator with screenshots (running dial, Lock Screen Live Activity, foreground sweep).
- **2026-07-04 (evening)** — Added count + streak goal kinds: additive `goalTypeName` on Goal (lightweight migration verified by installing the new build over old-build data), `StreakMath` (13 tests) + `GoalKindTests` (5), `ProgressLogger` extraction, kind picker in editor (create only), one-tap check-in UX, kind-aware list/detail/widget rendering, streak midnight widget entry, demo seeds ("20 workouts", "Meditate daily"). 48 tests green; list/detail/check-in/editor/migration verified in simulator with screenshots.
- **2026-07-04 (later)** — Course search now suggests as you type (350 ms debounce, cancels superseded requests). Added `CourseEditSheet` to fix a cached course's name/city/state (re-geocodes the passport pin) — reachable via press-and-hold on "Your courses" and the pencil on round setup. Round setup now shows the course's city/state. Root cause: OpenGolfAPI has bad location data on some records (e.g. Evansville Country Club, IN listed as "Winterrowd, IL" with wrong coordinates but a correct scorecard/street address).
- **2026-07-04** — Added the golf scorecard tab: TabView root, Sweetens Cove `GolfTheme`, OpenGolfAPI course search + import, hole-by-hole entry with stats (putts/FIR/GIR/penalties), round summary + share card, records, passport with map, celebrations/confetti. 5 new SwiftData models (additive schema change). EmberTests now depends on the Ember target (fixed clean-build test failures). 32 tests green; verified in simulator with screenshots.
- **2026-07-02** — Initialized git repo + this PROGRESS.md. Reconstructed state after a prior session terminated without a save. Confirmed build + tests green.
